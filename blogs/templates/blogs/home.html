                    <p>
                        After my arduous search to get my foot in the door of software engineering, I finally landed my dream at Captivea, an international multi-branched 
                        ERP Implementation company. Since starting back in May 2021, I've been doing some amazing work for our ITAR clients in Energy and Aerospace! Everyday is
                        an adventure, and I've been given the space to spread my wings and learn as much as I can about business processes, DevOps, QA, and the Odoo framework (which is surprisngly similar to Django).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>What have I learned?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Captivea works at a break neck pace, it feels like we are perpetually a start-up with how much work we have to deliver with such tight deadlines. With that stress, I've been able to expedite my learning
                        in Python, MVC, deploying on Linux servers, SQL scripting, developing modules and so much more! Listing everything I've learned would take up over 100 lines of code in HTML, and I'd rather not bore you with the details üòÖ 
                    </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        There's a few things honestly, but I've found myself paralyzed between choosing to learn iOS development, .NET Balzor WASM, or continuing my pursuit in the Django framework.
                        Each choice has an avenue of growth, but I find that I suffer from perpetually looking for the feeling of exploration and discovery.                    
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        If iOS I plan on reviving my old AI project (Recycpal) in light of 
                        recent release of Meta's <a href="https://segment-anything.com" target="_blank">Segment Anything</a>, and complement
                        it with a webapp (.NET or Django).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I have been designing a database for my girlfriends ecommerce website, epecially recently since we finished wireframing the UI MVP.

                <div class="card card-body shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white-rounded border-success h-100">
                    <h4>Short Term Goals üê∞</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Learn more, learn everything, and learn anything. I've learned that every experience that I had in all my other professions have prepared me for the roller coaster that is Captivea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be happier üòå I'm getting older and so is everyone else in my life, no matter how busy I get I want to prioritize those moments before the people that matter to me leave this 
                        world we call home. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stress less, and feel blessed. I noticed that I'm always sprinting to the next goal without stopping to breathe, and it takes a mental toll. However, I've found that responding to that
                        pressure with a moment of gratitude really does help balance that feeling of dread.
