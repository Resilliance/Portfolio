                    <h4>My journey thus far</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I started out of highschool becoming a pharmacy technician. Honestly, I thought I was going to end up in healthcare.
                        Only until I got deeper into the field and into the classes did I realize, that my heart wasn't in healthcare.
                        My engineering journey started with a 3D printer and a dream to make a prosthetic hand, from there I wanted to integrate hardware so I ended up looking into Arduino and micro controllers.
                         </p>

                    <p>I learned C/C++ primarily to control motors, sensors, and LEDs with the Arduino. Through all the headaches that come with learning programming, I felt a sense of fulfillment that was new to me.
                        One project led to another, and I found myself meeting friends that loved programming and building projects as much as I did and I started to pick up Python, Django, Swift, Java, etc.
                        Now I'm getting to a point where I have the confidence that I can build this website by myself and show off my code on GitHub!
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm still working on this website and deploying my other projects, but I hope you enjoy your look around my little cyber home üòÅ </p>

                    <h4>How I Taught Myself ü§ì</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I've found that I learn less efficiently in the classroom, not to say that I can't operate well in one.
                        I personally find it more effective and ingraining whenever I do my 'learning' by doing. 
                        All of my projects posted and unposted have contributed to my knowledge in software development.
                    </p>
                    <p> With that being said, I induldged myself into
                        development articles, forums, YouTube tutorials, and immense amounts of Google searches. All in the sake of trying to
                        progress my projects.

                <div class="card card-body shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white-rounded border-success h-100">
                    <h4>Short Term Goals üê∞</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Land my first software engineering position! Mainly because, I know that when I become an engineer I can look my parents
                        in the eyes and tell them "You can rest". I can't say that's only thing on my mind though!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deploying RecycPal on both Web and iOS is definitely up there on my list. Also deploying and testing the database for
                        PharmEasy, porting an AI onto a microcontroller, and maybe lose a couple pounds üòÖ
