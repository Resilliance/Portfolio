                    <p>
						I'm just a guy, who loves to program, problem solve, and help people. I've been tinkering with computers since I was 5, and built my first PC at 8! I bounced from the med-school track, to physician assistant, mechanical engineering, material science &amp; engineering, BACK to Biology, and finally found out software engineering was my thing!
                    </p>
					<p>
						With a heavy conscience I dropped out of the University of Central Florida in October 2021 and began teaching myself how to program after long hours working in the pharmacy. A lot of the stuff I made was small and largely unimpressive to an enterprise or seasoned developer, but it was mine and I was proud of it. For 8 months, I put in the hours after work hoping one day I could land a job that would give me a chance to prove myself. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My mentor and manager at the time, Se√±or Fernando, kept my spirits high and pushed to keep going despite my faith in myself waning. He always told me "You're one step closer to a yes, son!" and "Small progress is progress, no matter what anyone says." I owe a lot to him and my friends that believed in me when I didn't believe in myself.
					</p>
					<p>
						In May 2022, I got my shot, the Founder &amp; CEO of Captivea, Sebastian Riss, gave me a chance to prove myself and I took it; this was the best 25th birthday present I could have wished for! I've been working at Captivea since then and it's been an exciting rollercoaster of a ride. I've learned so much, met so many amazing people, and as my time with Captivea comes to a close, I'm excited to see what the next part of my life has to show me.

					<h4>Cool stuff I've done</h4> 
                    <hr>
						<blockquote>Although these may not be the most <i>spectacular</i> nor <i>complete</i> projects/feats, they are the ones that I'm most proud of.</blockquote>
					<p>
						- Made a website, called <a href="https://domain-force.com/">Domain Force</a>, that teaches developers/engineers from any level technical topics that are prevalent in industry.
					</p>
					<p>
						- Managed to create a module/script that remapped a whole data table of 100,000+ records in Odoo, an ERP system, in under 5 minutes. This was a time in my career where I didn't know SQL and I had to learn it in order to complete the task.
					</p>
					<p>
						- I made RecycPal's AI model, RecycPal is an object detection AI application that's designed to identify trash/recyclable materials, was a huge feat for me, I had no idea what I was doing and I still managed to figure out how to use PyTorch w/ React and PyTorch with Kivy, a python mobile app framework, to create a working prototype. I also taught myself how to program in Kotlin and Swift to create the mobile app versions of RecycPal.
					</p>
					<p>
						- Learned how to make a backend server with FastAPI and a mobile frontend with Kotlin (Android) in under a week, without any tutorials or help. Just documentation and a dream.
					</p>
					<p>
						- For a Captivea aerospace project/client, with the guidance of my Business Analyst and Project Manager I created a full-fledged Product Lifecycle Management system in Odoo in under 6 months. This was a huge feat for me, as it was my first project to be acting as 'lead' developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						- I learned Neovim!!! I know it's not a big deal, but it made my job so much more fun and it reminds me of the days when I was in highschool playing Starcraft II with my older brother.

                    <hr>
					<p>
						Currently trying to build my stamina and mental fortitude to run a half-marathon, and hopefully a full marathon by the end of 2024!
					</p>
					<p>
						Program-wise I'm really pushing to learn more Kotlin, Swift, and C++/C# to be able to make mobile application and games.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Be happier, I'm getting older and so is everyone else in my life, no matter how busy I get I want to prioritize those moments before the people that matter to me leave this world we call home. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
						Deploy a mobile game on the App Store and Google Play Store, I've always wanted to make a game and I think it's time to make that dream a reality.
