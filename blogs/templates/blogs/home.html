                    <h4>My journey thus far</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I started out of highschool becoming a pharmacy technician. Honestly, I thought I was going to end up in healthcare.
                        Only until I got deeper into the field and into the classes did I realize, that I liked to build and make 'things'!
                        I started with a 3D printer and a dream to make a prosthetic hand, from there I wanted to integrate hardware so I ended up looking into Arduino and micro controllers.
                         </p>

                    <p>I learned C/C++ primarily to control my motors, sensors, LEDs with the Arduino. Through all the headaches that come wih learning programming, I felt a sense of fulfillment that was new to me.
                        One project led to another, and I found myself meeting friends that loved programming and building projects as much as I did and I started to pick up Python, Django, Swift, Java, etc.
                        Now I'm getting to a point where I have the confidence that I can build this website by myself show off my code on GitHub!
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm still working on this website and deploying my other projects, but I hope you enjoy your look around my little cyber home üòÅ </p>
