                    The soil drencher project was actually a project I have known about but never actually
                    done because of the lack of need. You can think of this project as the “Hello World”
                    of hardware, it’s that popular. Granted it won a good amount of hackathons, but the 
                    need this time around was that my friend needed a teammate for his project. So of 
                    course I decided to be the Watson to his Sherlock and created a components list.

                    We agreed that I would handle the electronics and software while he handled the actual
                    mechanism that would water the plants. First thing’s first, I decided that we were going 
                    to use an Arduino as our microcontroller. It was the easiest and fastest deployment option
                    we had, not to mention the countless number of tutorials and forums online.

                We would use a DHT22 sensor to detect humidity (and temperature), and once the humidity drops below 70%,
                which is displayed on a 16x2 LCD, this would trigger the motor to 55% power. Now the DHT22 sensor will update every
                2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) which would be enough time for the water to seep into the soil to increase the humidity 
                and shut switch off the motor.

                Being honest I really had no idea about how my friend was going to do this
